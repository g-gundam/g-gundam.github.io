# About

- The [g-gundam](https://github.com/g-gundam) account originally started out as a way to post code on 4chan without doxxing myself.
- I had intended it to be a throwaway account, but it has since taken on a life of its own.
- Which timeline am I activating?
  + It looks like I'm doing some websockets work in Common Lisp.
  + A proper hunchensocket example should exist.
- It's been a while since I've looked at chartserver.jl.
