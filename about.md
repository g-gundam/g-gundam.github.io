# About

- The [g-gundam](https://github.com/g-gundam) account originally started out as a way to post code on 4chan without doxxing myself.
- I had intended it to be a throwaway account, but it has since taken on a life of its own.
- Currently revisiting my Julia libraries.
- I also want to start blogging about Emacs.
  + How should I start?
  + Maybe I could start with how to deal with unbalanced parentheses in paredit.
    - I did that.
  + Next, maybe talk about ctsf.
- I don't know what to do next.
