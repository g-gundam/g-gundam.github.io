# About

- The [g-gundam](https://github.com/g-gundam) account originally started out as a way to post code on 4chan without doxxing myself.
- I had intended it to be a throwaway account, but it has since taken on a life of its own.
- Which timeline am I activating?
  + Employment came and went in just 2 weeks.
  + It was too good to be true.
  + The grind continues.
  + At least the T14 arrived safely today.
- Just a little more Common Lisp, and then I'll be back to Julia.
  + Just a little more.
  + This web dev stuff was so easy compared to what I'm trying to do in Julia.
