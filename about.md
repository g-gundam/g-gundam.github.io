# About

- The [g-gundam](https://github.com/g-gundam) account originally started out as a way to post code on 4chan without doxxing myself.
- I had intended it to be a throwaway account, but it has since taken on a life of its own.
- Which timeline am I activating?
  + Apparently I'm a Common Lisp Programmer now.
  + Now that I've gotten my feet wet with it, I can see it's really capable and underappreciated.

# Desires

- I want to write about other things too.
  + Emacs and Elisp
  + Perl
  + Maybe some Common Lisp
