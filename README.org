  + I like his take on Tufte.
  + I eventually want to have a cool table of contents like him.
  + I'd also like to have a proper blog at one point.

  + I was using =M-x describe-face= in Emacs to pick out colors for the blog.
  + My site theme is a port of catppuccin-mocha.

** <2024-12-27 Fri> A new site is born.
- I needed a place to publish a static export of a notebook.
- I had also wanted to setup a technical blog for a while.
- I almost used [[https://github.com/loikein/hugo-tufte][hugo-tufte]] for this, but the latest version of Hugo deprecated a bunch of features it was using, and I don't know Hugo well enough to port it.
- Then I looked at Franklin.jl, and it looked usable.
  + I didn't realize it didn't include much support for setting up a blog though.
  + Anyone who wants a blog via Franklin.jl needs to roll their own.
- Instead of a blog, I started with a few static pages, and maybe I'll turn it into a blog later.
- The most important thing to do was to host the static export of my [[https://g-gundam.github.io/notebooks/01.hma-4h-improvements/][first backtesting session ever in Pluto.jl]].
